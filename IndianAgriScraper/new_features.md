# Advanced Features for Agriculture Web Scraper

## Proposed Advanced Features

### 1. Content Analysis Module

- **Text Classification**: Automatically classify scraped text as relevant/irrelevant to agriculture using a machine learning model
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze sentiment in agriculture-related discussions to identify farmer concerns
- **Regional Context Detection**: Identify region-specific content (e.g., crops specific to Punjab vs Karnataka)
- **Crop Calendar Integration**: Extract and organize information according to crop growing seasons

### 2. Source Validity Assessment

- **Authority Scoring**: Rank sources based on their authority/reliability in the agriculture field
- **Content Freshness**: Track content publication dates and prioritize recent information
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Compare information across multiple sources to validate accuracy
- **Academic Source Detection**: Identify and prioritize content from agricultural universities and research institutions

### 3. Enhanced Media Processing

- **Image Classification**: Automatically categorize images (crops, machinery, diseases, etc.)
- **Chart & Graph Data Extraction**: Convert visual data from charts into tabular format
- **Geolocation Data Extraction**: Extract and map location data from content to create region-specific knowledge bases
- **Weather Data Integration**: Connect content with relevant weather patterns mentioned in the text

### 4. Multi-language Support

- **Regional Language Processing**: Add support for major Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, etc.)
- **Transliteration**: Convert regional terms to standard form for better searchability
- **Dialect Recognition**: Identify and process regional agricultural terminology

### 5. Structured Data Extraction

- **Input Cost Extraction**: Automatically identify and extract mentions of agricultural input costs
- **Yield Data Formatting**: Extract crop yield statistics into comparable formats
- **Best Practices Collection**: Identify and organize farming best practices mentioned in content
- **Problem-Solution Pairing**: Match agricultural problems with their solutions across documents

### 6. Integration Features

- **API Access**: Allow other systems to access the scraper via RESTful API
- **Scheduled Scraping**: Set up automatic scraping on schedules to keep data fresh
- **Webhook Notifications**: Send notifications when new relevant content is identified
- **Data Export in Multiple Formats**: Support additional export formats beyond current options (e.g., SQL dumps, XML)

### 7. Advanced Search Capabilities

- **Semantic Search Improvement**: Enhance search with embeddings-based similarity rather than just keyword matching
- **Filter by Source Type**: Allow searching by source credibility/type
- **Filter by Date Range**: Search content within specific time periods
- **Search by Agricultural Domain**: Search specifically within crop cultivation, animal husbandry, etc.

### 8. Visualization Tools

- **Topic Clustering**: Visual representation of related agricultural topics
- **Trend Analysis**: Show how agricultural discussions/topics change over time
- **Geographic Heat Maps**: Display regional distribution of agricultural information
- **Crop Production Visualization**: Visual comparison of crop statistics
