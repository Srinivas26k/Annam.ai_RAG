1. What is the role of Soil:**A in Indian agriculture?

**What is Soil:**A soil can be defined as the outermost layer of the earth’s crust which plays a major role in growing food and trees. It contains organisms and also consists of minerals, organic matter (humus), water, gases, and air.**Soil Formation**: How the soil formed? well, soil formation is a very long process and actually begins with the weathering of rocks into small fragments. The origin of soil is from rocks (parent material), usually formed when rocks are exposed to the atmosphere in the process of physical and chemical decomposition. Parent material (usually rocks) and the process of soil formation decide the soil properties. The soils in India are divided into 2 broad categories based on their formation.

2. What is the importance of **Soil Types in Indian agriculture?

**Soil Types – Soil Profile and Horizon:**As we know soils are made of layers which are also called “Horizons”. These all layers (horizons) put together to form a soil profile. The soil profile indicates the complete history of soil formation and its ingredients of it. In general, a soil profile consists of 6 horizons.

4. What are the agricultural practices in Northern India?

**Regions –**You can find Alluvial soils in most part of the delta regions of Northern India. This soil covers more than 35% of the total land in India.**Characteristics –**These soils are rich in nutrients like phosphoric acid and organic matter (humus). However, they are poor in nitrogen and potash. Alluvial soils are a mixture of clay and sand (loam). These soils tend to be sandier and can quick-draining properties than many other soils.**Suitable Crops of Alluvial Soils –**Tobacco, Cotton, Rice, Wheat, Bajra, Sorghum (Jowar), Pea, Pigeon pea, Chickpea, Black gram, Green gram, Soybean, Groundnut, Mustard, Linseed, Sesame, Barley, Jute, Maize, any Oilseeds, vegetables, and fruits are suitable in these soils under ideal irrigation.

5. How is Cotton used in Indian agriculture?

**Regions –**Black soils are also called Cotton soils or Regur Soils. These soils mainly found in the Deccan lava tract which includes the states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. Mostly, you can find this type of soil in the river valley Godavari, Krishna, Narmada, and Tapi. Black soils are formed due to the weathering of the lava rocks.**Characteristics –**Black soils are rich in iron, lime, magnesium, and aluminum. However, they are poor in phosphorus, nitrogen, and humus (organic matter). Usually, this soil gets its black colour from various salts or from humus during soil formation. Black soils contain a large amount of clay but are sandy as well in hillier regions of the country. Black soils become sticky when wet and develop wide cracks during the dry season.**Suitable Crops of Black Soils –**The black soil moisture very well hence it’s excellent for growing cotton. This is also popularly known as black cotton soil. However, there are many other crops that can be grown in these soils are; Rice and sugarcane, wheat, Jowar, linseed, sunflower, cereal crops, citrus fruits, vegetables, tobacco, groundnut, any oilseed crops, and millets.

6. What are the agricultural practices in Chhattisgarh?

**Regions –**These soils are found in parts of Chhattisgarh, Deccan plateau, Orissa, and the Western Ghats.**Characteristics –**These soils are red in color due to the presence of iron oxide. These are formed due weathering of metamorphic rocks. These soils are sandy and somewhat acidic and rich in potash. However, they are very poor in lime, nitrogen, phosphorous, magnesium, organic matter (humus).**Suitable Crops of Red and Yellow Soils –**Rice, wheat, sugarcane, maize/corn, groundnut, ragi (finger millet) and potato, oilseeds, pulses, millets, and fruits such as mango, orange, citrus, and vegetables can be grown under ideal irrigation.

**Regions –**Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Assam.**Characteristics –**These soils acidic in nature and are poor in humus (organic matter), phosphate, nitrogen, and calcium. Laterite soils are very rich in iron.**Suitable Crops of Laterite Soils –**These soil are not very fertile and are used in cotton growing, rice cultivation, wheat cultivation, pulses growing, cultivation of tea, growing coffee, growing rubber, growing coconut, and growing cashews. Most of the time this soil is used to make bricks due to the presence of large amounts of iron.

15. What is the importance of Soil Testing in Indian agriculture?

**Soil Testing and its Need: A soil** test is performed to analyze soil samples to determine nutrient content, composition, and other characteristics such as acidity or pH level. Commercial crop growers should adopt this practice before starting a plantation. This soil test allows determining the nutrients and micro-nutrient deficiencies so that farmers can supplement these nutrients to make the soil fertile. Based on soil test results, farmers can choose appropriate manures and fertilizers for better crop yields. For measuring soil pH, farmers can buy soil pH meters and check soil acidic levels. This meter is also helpful, especially for indoor gardening, container gardening, greenhouse/Polyhouse farming.

15. What is the importance of The forest soils in Indian agriculture?

@Shashank and @Ravi: The forest soils vary in structure and texture depending on the mountain environment where they are formed. In the snow-bound areas of the Himalayas, they experience denudation and are acidic with low humus content. The soils found in the lower valleys are fertile. (Reference NCERT – India Physical Environment Page 72). In general in forest soil, as the trees have different root system unlike grasslands, the chance of that to decay and get added as humus in the soil is less.
