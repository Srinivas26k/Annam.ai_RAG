[[28]](#cite_note-India:_Global_Food_Security_Index-28)India has shown a steady average nationwide annual increase in the mass-produced per hectare for some agricultural items, over the last 60 years. These gains have come mainly from India's [green revolution](/wiki/Green_Revolution), improving road and power generation infrastructure, knowledge of gains and reforms. [29] Despite these recent accomplishments, agriculture has the potential for major productivity and total output gains, because crop yields in India are still just 30% to 60% of the best sustainable crop yields achievable in the farms of developed and other developing countries.

26. What are the agricultural practices in India?

[[49]](#cite_note-49)Before the 18th century, cultivation of sugarcane was largely confined to India. A few merchants began to trade in sugar – a luxury and an expensive spice in Europe until the 18th century. Sugar became widely popular in 18th-century Europe, then graduated to become a human necessity in the 19th century all over the world. Sugarcane plantations, just like [cotton](/wiki/Cotton) farms, became a major driver of large and forced human migrations in the 19th century and early 20th century – of people from Africa and from India, both in millions – influencing the ethnic mix, political conflicts and cultural evolution of Caribbean, South American, Indian Ocean and Pacific Island nations.[[50]](#cite_note-50)[[51]](#cite_note-51)

30. What are the agricultural practices in India?

Before the mid-1960s, India relied on imports and food aid to meet domestic requirements. However, two years of severe drought in 1965 and 1966 convinced India to reform its agricultural policy and that it could not rely on foreign aid and imports for food security. India adopted significant policy reforms focused on the goal of food grain self-sufficiency. This ushered in India's [Green Revolution](/wiki/Green_Revolution). It began with the decision to adopt superior yielding, disease resistant wheat varieties in combination with better farming knowledge to improve productivity. The state of [Punjab](/wiki/Punjab_(India)) led India's [green revolution](/wiki/Green_Revolution) and earned the distinction of being the country's breadbasket.[[59]](#cite_note-:3-59)

31. What are the agricultural practices in Punjab,_India?

The initial increase in production was centred on the irrigated areas of the states of [Punjab](/wiki/Punjab,_India), [Haryana](/wiki/Haryana) and western [Uttar Pradesh](/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh). With the farmers and the government officials focusing on farm productivity and knowledge transfer, India's total food grain production soared. A hectare of Indian wheat farm that produced an average of 0.8 tonnes in 1948, produced 4.7 tonnes of wheat in 1975 from the same land. Such rapid growth in farm productivity enabled India to become self-sufficient by the 1970s. It also empowered the smallholder farmers to seek further means to increase food staples produced per hectare. By 2000, Indian farms were adopting wheat varieties capable of yielding 6 tonnes of wheat per hectare.[[21]](#cite_note-fao1a-21)[[60]](#cite_note-60)

32. What are the agricultural practices in India?

With agricultural policy success in wheat, India's Green Revolution technology spread to rice. However, since irrigation infrastructure was very poor, Indian farmers innovated with tube-wells, to harvest [ground water](/wiki/Ground_water). When gains from the new technology reached their limits in the states of initial adoption, the technology spread in the 1970s and 1980s to the states of eastern India — [Bihar](/wiki/Bihar), [Odisha](/wiki/Odisha) and [West Bengal](/wiki/West_Bengal). The lasting benefits of the improved seeds and new technology extended principally to the irrigated areas which account for about one-third of the harvested crop area. In the 1980s, Indian agriculture policy shifted to "evolution of a production pattern in line with the demand pattern" leading to a shift in emphasis to other agricultural commodities like oilseed, fruit and vegetables. Farmers began adopting improved methods and technologies in dairying, fisheries and livestock, and meeting the diversified food needs of a growing population.

33. What are the agricultural practices in India?

As with rice, the lasting benefits of improved seeds and improved farming technologies now largely depends on whether India develops infrastructure such as irrigation network, flood control systems, reliable electricity production capacity, all-season rural and urban highways, cold storage to prevent spoilage, modern retail, and competitive buyers of produce from Indian farmers. This is increasingly the focus of Indian agriculture policy.

34. What are the agricultural practices in India?

India ranks 74 out of 113 major countries in terms of [food security index](/wiki/Global_food_security_index). [28] India's agricultural economy is undergoing structural changes. Between 1970 and 2011, the GDP share of agriculture has fallen from 43% to 16%. This isn't because of reduced importance of agriculture or a consequence of agricultural policy; rather, it is largely due to the rapid economic growth in services, industrial output, and non-agricultural sectors in India between 2000 and 2010.

43. What are the agricultural practices in India?

In addition to growth in total output, agriculture in India has shown an increase in average agricultural output per hectare in last 60 years. The table below presents average farm productivity in India over three farming years for some crops. Improving road and power generation infrastructure, knowledge gains and reforms has allowed India to increase farm productivity between 40% and 500% over 40 years. [29] India's recent accomplishments in crop yields while being impressive, are still just 30% to 60% of the best crop yields achievable in the farms of developed as well as other developing countries. Additionally, despite these gains in farm productivity, losses after harvest due to poor infrastructure and unorganised retail cause India to experience some of the highest food losses in the world.

49. What are the agricultural practices in India?

India and China are competing to establish the world record on rice yields. [Yuan Longping](/wiki/Yuan_Longping) of China National Hybrid Rice Research and Development Centre set a world record for rice yield in 2010 at 19 tonnes per hectare in a demonstration plot. In 2011, this record was surpassed by an Indian farmer, Sumant Kumar, with 22.4 tonnes per hectare in Bihar, also in a demonstration plot. These farmers claim to have employed newly developed rice breeds and system of rice intensification (SRI), a recent innovation in farming. The claimed Chinese and Indian yields have yet to be demonstrated on 7 hectare farm lots and that these are reproducible over two consecutive years on the same farm.[[86]](#cite_note-86)[[87]](#cite_note-87)[[88]](#cite_note-88)[[89]](#cite_note-89)

57. What are the agricultural practices in India?

Dairy farming based on the [Amul Pattern](/wiki/Amul), with a single marketing cooperative, is India's largest self-sustaining industry and its largest rural employment provider. Successful implementation of the Amul model has made India the world's largest milk producer. [107] Here small, marginal farmers with a couple or so heads of milch cattle queue up twice daily to pour milk from their small containers into the village union collection points. The milk after processing at the district unions is then marketed by the state cooperative federation nationally under the Amul brand name, India's largest food brand. With the Anand pattern three-fourth of the price paid by the mainly urban consumers goes into the hands of millions of small dairy farmers, who are the owners of the brand and the cooperative.

59. What are the agricultural practices in India?

"Slow agricultural growth is a concern for policymakers as some two-thirds of India's people depend on rural employment for a living. Current agricultural practices are neither economically nor environmentally sustainable and India's yields for many agricultural commodities are low. Poorly maintained irrigation systems and almost universal lack of good extension services are among the factors responsible. Farmers' access to markets is hampered by poor roads, rudimentary market infrastructure, and excessive regulation."

"With a population of just over 1.3 billion, India is the world's largest democracy. In the past decade, the country has witnessed accelerated economic growth, emerged as a global player with the world's fourth largest economy in purchasing power parity terms, and made progress towards achieving most of the Millennium Development Goals. India's integration into the global economy has been accompanied by impressive economic growth that has brought significant economic and social benefits to the country. Nevertheless, disparities in income and human development are on the rise. Preliminary estimates suggest that in 2009–10 the combined all India poverty rate was 32 % compared to 37 % in 2004–05. Going forward, it will be essential for India to build a productive, competitive, and diversified agricultural sector and facilitate rural, non-farm entrepreneurship and employment. Encouraging policies that promote competition in agricultural marketing will ensure that farmers receive better prices."

A 2003 analysis of India's agricultural growth from 1970 to 2001 by the [Food and Agriculture Organization](/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization) identified systemic problems in Indian agriculture. For food staples, the annual growth rate in production during the six-year segments 1970–76, 1976–82, 1982–88, 1988–1994, 1994–2000 were found to be respectively 2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 2.6, and 1.8% per annum. Corresponding analyses for the index of total agricultural production show a similar pattern, with the growth rate for 1994–2000 attaining only 1.5% per annum.[[112]](#cite_note-112)

India has very poor rural roads affecting timely supply of inputs and timely transfer of outputs from Indian farms. Irrigation systems are inadequate, leading to crop failures in some parts of the country because of lack of water. In other areas regional floods, poor seed quality and inefficient farming practices, lack of cold storage and harvest spoilage cause over 30% of farmer's produce going to waste, lack of [organised retail](/wiki/Retailing_in_India) and competing buyers thereby limiting Indian farmer's ability to sell the surplus and commercial crops.

Although India has attained self-sufficiency in food staples, the productivity of its farms is below that of Brazil, the United States, France and other nations. Indian [wheat](/wiki/Wheat) farms, for example, produce about a third of the wheat per hectare per year compared to farms in France. Rice productivity in India was less than half that of China. Other staples productivity in India is similarly low. Indian [total factor productivity](/wiki/Total_factor_productivity) growth remains below 2% per annum; in contrast, China's total factor productivity growths is about 6% per annum, even though China also has [smallholding](/wiki/Smallholding) farmers.

Crop yields for some farms in India are within 90% of the best achieved yields by farms in developed countries such as the United States and in European Union. No single state of India is best in every crop. Tamil Nadu achieved highest yields in rice and sugarcane, [Haryana](/wiki/Haryana) in wheat and coarse grains, Karnataka in cotton, Bihar in pulses, while other states do well in horticulture, aquaculture, flower and fruit plantations. These differences in agricultural productivity are a function of local infrastructure, [soil quality](/wiki/Soil_quality), micro-climates, local resources, farmer knowledge and innovations.[[116]](#cite_note-ap1-116)

71. What is the importance of The average size in Indian agriculture?

- The average size of land holdings is very small (less than 2 hectares) and is subject to fragmentation due to land ceiling acts, and in some cases, family disputes. Such small holdings are often over-manned, resulting in disguised unemployment and low productivity of labour. Some reports claim smallholder farming may not be cause of poor productivity, since the productivity is higher in China and many developing economies even though China smallholder farmers constitute over 97% of its farming population. A Chinese smallholder farmer is able to rent his land to larger farmers, China's organised retail and extensive Chinese highways are able to provide the incentive and infrastructure necessary to its farmers for sharp increases in farm productivity.[[117]](#cite_note-117) - Adoption of modern agricultural practices and use of [technology](/wiki/Agricultural_machinery)is inadequate in comparison with Green Revolution methods and technologies, hampered by ignorance of such practices, high costs and impracticality in the case of small land holdings. - According to the [World Bank](/wiki/World_Bank), Indian branch's*Priorities for Agriculture and Rural Development*, India's large[agricultural subsidies](/wiki/Agricultural_subsidies)are hampering productivity-enhancing investment. This evaluation is based largely on a productivity agenda and does not take any ecological implications into account. According to a neo-liberal view, over-regulation of agriculture has increased costs, price risks and uncertainty because the government intervenes in labour, land, and credit markets. India has inadequate infrastructure and services.The World Bank also says that the allocation of water is inefficient, unsustainable and inequitable. The[[118]](#cite_note-agriculturepriorities-118)[irrigation](/wiki/Irrigation)infrastructure is deteriorating.The overuse of water is being covered by over-pumping aquifers but, as these are falling by one foot of groundwater each year, this is a limited resource.[[118]](#cite_note-agriculturepriorities-118)The[[119]](#cite_note-119)[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change)released a report that food security may be a big problem in the region post 2030.[[120]](#cite_note-120) - Illiteracy, general socio-economic backwardness, slow progress in implementing land reforms and inadequate or inefficient finance and marketing services for farm produce. - Inconsistent government policy. Agricultural subsidies and taxes are often changed without notice for short term political ends. - Irrigation facilities are inadequate, as revealed by the fact that only 52.6% of the land was irrigated in 2003–04, which result in farmers still being dependent on rainfall, specifically the[[121]](#cite_note-agri-121)[monsoon](/wiki/Monsoon)season. A good monsoon results in a robust growth for the economy, while a poor monsoon leads to a sluggish growth.Farm credit is regulated by[[122]](#cite_note-schand-ind.eco-3-122)[NABARD](/wiki/NABARD), which is the statutory apex agent for rural development in the subcontinent. At the same time, over-pumping made possible by subsidised electric power is leading to an alarming drop in aquifer levels.[[123]](#cite_note-123)[[124]](#cite_note-124)[[125]](#cite_note-125) - A third of all food that is produced rots due to inefficient supply chains and the use of the " [Walmart model](/wiki/Walmarting)" to improve efficiency is blocked by laws against foreign investment in the retail sector.[[126]](#cite_note-126)

72. What does Indian National Policy for Farmers do for Indian agriculture?

Indian National Policy for Farmers of 2007 [133] stated that "prime farmland must be conserved for agriculture except under exceptional circumstances, provided that the agencies that are provided with agricultural land for non-agricultural projects should compensate for treatment and full development of equivalent degraded or wastelands elsewhere". The policy suggested that, as far as possible, land with low farming yields or that was not farmable should be earmarked for non-agricultural purposes such as construction, industrial parks and other commercial development.
