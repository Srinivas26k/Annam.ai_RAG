            "- FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE Foot and Mouth Disease is caused by Picornavirus. It is a contagious disease and cause severe economic loss in susceptible all cloven-hoofed animals. It is the smallest of the Animal virus present in 7 types virus namely O,A,C Asia I, SAT 1,2,3. There is no cross protection of different strains and hence vaccination is not able to control the infection in all conditions. This disease is transmissible by direct contact with infected materials. Symptoms • Fever (40-41ºC), dullness, anorexia, and fall in milk production. • Vesicles (fluid-filled blisters) and erosions in the mouth, nose, teats and feet. • Excessive salivation; drooling, serous nasal discharge; shaking, kicking of the feet or lameness • Vesicle (blister) formation in the tongue, dental pad, gums, soft palate, nostrils, muzzle, inter-digital space, coronary band, and teats. • Pregnant cows may abort, and young calves may die without developing any vesicle. • The course of an FMD infection is 2 to 3 weeks. • Secondary infection may delay recovery. Treatment : • Antibiotics may be administered to counter bacterial infections. Prevention & Control : • Vaccinate the calf at third month of age and again vaccinate once in 4-6 months regular interval. • Sprinkle 3-4 % concentrate solution of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in the shed. Bleaching powder may also spread in the animal shed. • The affected animal must be separated from other animal and provide treatment. • Calf should be fed milk with affected animal. • Animal movement should be restricted.
